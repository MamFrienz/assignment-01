jQuery plugin that automatically saves form values in the client side (using HTML5 localStorage) and restore them on our next visit. Bt i tried to my best to do something.
Currently: we input our own verified data)
 and also we reset user input when apps is destroyed.
Currently: inputs will still contain their values)



Compatibility:
Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera Mini.
